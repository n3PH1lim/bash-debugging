# bash_debugging
Template with code snippets for debugging bash scripts

Sometimes i need to debug some scripts while i write it.

I have found a solution that is pretty simple for me.

As you can see in the script i used the function decho this function prints some more information when the global debug variable DEBUG is set to 1.

It also prints the output to an logfile.
In this case in the folder where the script is started.

And here you can see how it looks:

![Alt text](/debug_test.png?raw=true "Optional Title")
